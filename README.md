# Synthetic Data Generation for LLM Training

This project demonstrates the process of generating synthetic data to enhance training datasets for large language models (LLMs). The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Generation**: Augments training data using techniques like paraphrasing and style transfer.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Trains a pre-trained model using the synthetic data.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the model and tracks performance improvement.

## Getting Started
